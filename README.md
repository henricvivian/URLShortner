# URL Shortener
This is a Python program that allows you to shorten a long URL into a shorter one using the bit.ly service. It uses the pyshorteners module to interact with the bit.ly API.

# Installation
To use this program, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your system, as well as the pyshorteners module. You can install pyshorteners using pip:

```bash
    pip install pyshorteners
```
You'll also need a bit.ly API key to use the service. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free account on the bit.ly website and obtain one from your account settings.

# Usage
To use the program, simply run the URLShortener.py script:

```bash
    python URLShortener.py
```
You'll be prompted to enter the URL you want to shorten. Once you enter the URL, the program will use the bit.ly service to generate a shortened URL, which will be displayed on the screen.
